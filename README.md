# HappyToes ecommerce Website

**HappyToes** is a responsive ecommerce website created by **Yash Magane**, **Louise**, and **Yorick**.  
The project was part of **TFS â€“ Challenge 4: Company Website**, where the goal was to design and develop a website for a fictional business selling socks.  

Our aim was to build a polished, modern website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, while following best practices such as **BEM naming conventions**, **JavaScript modules**, and **collaborative version control** through GitHub.

## Project Overview

### Brief
> Create a company website that sells a chosen product to a target market, based on a supplied Figma design.

We decided to build a website for **HappyToes**, an online sock company offering fun, stylish, and comfortable socks.  
The project included:
- A **Home page**
- An **About page**
- A **Product listings page**

The design was inspired by the provided [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/design/e1dVmC3jY27kmNUPxSYj5G/TechNative---Challenge---Company-Website), adapted to suit our own branding and theme.

## Design & Layout

- Fully **responsive** for both desktop and mobile viewports  
- **Consistent font and colour scheme** throughout  
- Based on the provided Figma design but customised for brand identity  
- Used **CSS variables** for easy theming and consistent styling  
- **Split CSS files** per page for better structure and maintainability

## Functionality

- **Tabs** implemented with JavaScript modules  
- **Review section animation** on the Home page  
- **Search bar** on the Product listings page, search bar filters products dynamically as the user types  
- **Contact form** on the About page user input is validated and displays a thank you message upon submission  
- Hosted and version controlled via **GitHub Pages**

## Development Approach & Workflow

### Team Collaboration
This project was a **collaborative effort** between **Yash**, **Louise**, and **Yorick**. We adopted a professional development workflow using GitHubâ€™s built in tools to manage tasks and avoid merge conflicts.

### Tools & Workflow
- **GitHub Projects (Kanban board)** for task management  
- **Issues & Pull Requests** to track progress and review code before merging  
- **Feature branching** for isolated development and conflict free merging   
- **Frequent commits and rebasing** to maintain clean, up to date branches  

### Benefits
- Improved **team coordination**  
- Practiced **collaborative Git workflows** (branching, reviewing, merging)  
- Built strong understanding of **version control and team-based development**
